# Remind

A discord bot that sends reminders for future contests using [clist](https://clist.by/) API.

## Contributing

We are using [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) for formatting the code.

`pycodestyle .` must generate no errors before accepting the PR.
  
Shotout to [TLE](https://github.com/cheran-senthil/TLE) developers for the idea and initial contributions to this bot. Their bot used to remind about Codeforces contests and we enhanced it for all other judges.
